### ⏳ Future Work (Deferred)

Items identified but deferred to future releases:

1. **SHA-256 Checksum Verification**
   - Requires manifest generation in release pipeline
   - Sigstore attestation integration
   - Timeline: Q1 2025

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Telemetry for repeated failures
   - Timeline: Q1 2025

3. **Structured JSON Logging**
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Privacy-preserving telemetry
   - Opt-in with environment flags
   - Timeline: Q2 2025

4. **CI Lint for Nested Decorators**
   - Custom pre-commit hook
   - Prevents regression of guard-rails pattern
   - Timeline: Next sprint

## Key Achievements

### Security Posture

- **Before:** No security policy, implicit threat models, missing safety rails
- **After:** Published security policy, documented threat model, comprehensive safety features

### Documentation Quality

- **Before:** Safety features undocumented, rollback process unclear
- **After:** 3 new comprehensive guides (19KB), complete operational runbooks

### Code Quality

- **Before:** Outdated dependencies, missing guard-rails command
- **After:** Latest tool versions, full guard-rails pipeline implemented

### Test Coverage

- **Before:** Some paths untested (dangerous paths, asset sanitization)
- **After:** Complete coverage for safety features, maintained 85%+ threshold

## Validation

All changes have been:
- ✅ Implemented with minimal code changes (surgical approach)
- ✅ Tested with new and existing test coverage
- ✅ Documented in relevant guides
- ✅ Validated against Next_Steps.md requirements
- ✅ Committed with clear, atomic commits

## Integration Points

### Pre-commit Hooks
The guard-rails command integrates with existing pre-commit infrastructure:
```bash
uv run hephaestus guard-rails
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
Ready for CI integration:
```yaml
- name: Run guard rails
  run: uv run hephaestus guard-rails
```

### Release Process
Enhanced with:
- Security checklist in pre-release-checklist.md
- Rollback procedures for incidents
- Security advisory templates

## Migration Guide for Users

### New Commands

**Guard-rails (replaces manual quality checks):**
```bash
# Old way (multiple commands)
uv run hephaestus cleanup --deep-clean
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv run mypy src tests
uv run pytest
uv run pip-audit --strict

# New way (single command)
uv run hephaestus guard-rails

# Skip formatting if reviewing changes
uv run hephaestus guard-rails --no-format
```

### Safety Features

**Cleanup now refuses dangerous paths:**
```bash
# This now fails with clear error message
hephaestus cleanup /
# Error: Refusing to clean dangerous path: /

# This still works (safe)
hephaestus cleanup ./my-project
```

### Security Reporting

**New disclosure process:**
- Email: opensource@hephaestus.dev
- Response: 48 hours
- Updates: Every 5-7 business days
- Resolution: 14 days for critical issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Corrupted File Recovery**: Encountered corrupted `cli.py` - restored from git with proper imports
2. **Test Independence**: pytest-randomly catches hidden test dependencies
3. **Safety First**: Dangerous path validation prevents catastrophic mistakes
4. **Documentation Pays**: Comprehensive guides reduce support burden
5. **Incremental Progress**: Small, tested changes are safer than large refactors
