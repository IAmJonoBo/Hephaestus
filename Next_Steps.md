# Next Steps Tracker

Last updated: 2025-02-XX (API streaming + remediation automation)

## Current Status Summary

### All Critical Infrastructure: ✅ COMPLETE

The Hephaestus project has successfully delivered all high-priority features and infrastructure:

- ✅ Security hardening (checksums, Sigstore, dangerous path protection, SECURITY.md, STRIDE threat model)
- ✅ Quality gates (guard-rails, drift detection, CodeQL, comprehensive test coverage)
- ✅ AI integration (schema export, agent guide, ranking API, structured logging)
- ✅ Documentation (MkDocs site, Diátaxis structure, comprehensive how-tos)
- ✅ Developer experience (cleanup safety, dry-run previews, audit manifests)

### Future Work: Planned & Scheduled

Remaining work is focused on advanced features with clear ADRs and sprint-based timelines:

- 🔄 ADR-0006: Sigstore bundle backfill Sprint 2 (execution ready, pending manual trigger)
- 🔄 ADR-0005: PyPI publication Sprint 3 (workflow complete, pending account registration)
- ⏳ ADR-0003: OpenTelemetry Sprint 4 (sampling strategies, plugin instrumentation, Prometheus exporter)
- ⏳ ADR-0004: REST/gRPC API Sprint 2+ (FastAPI implementation, authentication, gRPC service)
- ⏳ ADR-0002: Plugin architecture Sprint 4 (marketplace, dependency resolution, versioning)

## Recent Improvements (Latest Session)

**API Service Hardening (2025-02-XX):**

- ✅ Replaced REST and gRPC guard-rails and cleanup stubs with shared execution helpers exposing real cleanup manifests, plugin readiness, and drift summaries.
- ✅ Unified analytics rankings and hotspot outputs across REST and gRPC by routing through the toolkit analytics pipeline with synthetic fallbacks when no datasets are configured.
- ✅ Regenerated protobuf definitions to add `auto_remediate` support and aligned CI-safe cleanup previews between HTTP and gRPC flows.
- 🔄 Follow-up: persist streaming analytics snapshots for ranking inputs and emit remediation telemetry for API consumers.
- ✅ Guard-rails helpers now fail closed when required plugin tooling is missing and surface the missing inventory in both REST helpers and unit coverage.

**API Streaming & Remediation Automation (2025-02-XX):**

- ✅ Implemented FastAPI analytics streaming ingestion with NDJSON parsing, bounded buffering, and shared ingestion telemetry for REST and gRPC surfaces.
- ✅ Extended gRPC analytics service with client-streaming ingestion RPC and regression coverage for acceptance/rejection flows.
- ✅ Added automated drift remediation path (`--auto-remediate`) with command execution telemetry, plus CI drift gate (`uv run hephaestus guard-rails --drift`).
- ✅ Introduced shared streaming analytics ingestor with snapshot API and reset hooks for deterministic testing.
- 🔄 Follow-up: expand analytics streaming persistence/retention policies and surface ingestion metrics over OpenTelemetry exporters.

**Release & Plugin Hardening (2025-02-XX):**

- ✅ Expanded CLI coverage to exercise `release install --remove-archive` cleanup and Sigstore backfill flows, lifting overall coverage to 86.95% (338 passed, 4 skipped).
- ✅ Added regression tests for Ruff plugin failure handling and gRPC optional dependencies, ensuring modules skip cleanly when toolchains are absent.
- ✅ Tightened lint gates by excluding generated protobuf stubs, modernising typing usage, and fixing import ordering across telemetry/plugin scaffolding.
- ✅ Documented security scan limitations (pip-audit SSL chain) and kept build pipeline (`uv build`) green for release packaging.
- 🔄 Follow-up: extend CLI cleanup pipeline tests to cover confirmation prompts/out-of-root warnings and plug remaining uncovered branches.

**Telemetry Fallback Hardening (2025-02-XX):**

- ✅ Rebuilt `hephaestus.telemetry` shims to provide typed fallbacks with deterministic no-op behaviour when OpenTelemetry is absent.
- ✅ Re-ran type checking (`uv run mypy src tests`) to confirm the TaskManager and REST changes compile cleanly.
- ✅ Re-validated REST regression suites (`uv run pytest`) to ensure SSE/task polling updates remain green (345 passed, 3 skipped, 85.51% coverage).
- ✅ Targeted lint pass for the touched telemetry module (`uv run ruff check src/hephaestus/telemetry/__init__.py`).
- ⚠️ `uv run pip-audit` blocked by container SSL trust chain; document waiver and retry once trust store is patched.
- 🔄 Follow-up: reconcile repository-wide Ruff violations in generated gRPC assets without regressing proto sync (coordinate with tooling owner).

**E2E Testing & Validation (2025-10-09):**

- ✅ Comprehensive E2E test suite (8 tests) covering setup, cleanup, and Renovate workflows
- ✅ Critical bug fix: Cleanup now preserves site-packages in virtual environments
- ✅ Yamllint configuration fix: Removed hardcoded non-existent config path
- ✅ E2E testing documentation guide (docs/how-to/e2e-testing.md)
- ✅ Regression tests for site-packages preservation
- ✅ Renovate compatibility tests for dependency updates
- ✅ All tests passing (185 passed, 86.76% coverage)
- ✅ Setup-dev-env.sh validated E2E with guard-rails pipeline

**Authentication & Authorization Hardening (2025-01-XX):**

- ✅ Token validation before GitHub API calls with format validation
- ✅ Support for classic, fine-grained, and PAT GitHub token formats
- ✅ Token expiration detection with clear HTTP 401 error messages
- ✅ Added telemetry event for token validation warnings
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (7 new tests)

**AI-Native Workflows & Analytics (2025-01-XX):**

- ✅ Analytics ranking API: 4 strategies (risk_weighted, coverage_first, churn_based, composite)
- ✅ CLI command: `hephaestus tools refactor rankings` with strategy selection
- ✅ Command schema export: `hephaestus schema` for AI agent integration
- ✅ AI integration guide: Comprehensive docs for Copilot/Cursor/Claude
- ✅ Guard-rails drift detection: `hephaestus guard-rails --drift` with remediation

- ✅ Sigstore attestation verification: Wheelhouse installs now validate Sigstore bundles with optional identity pinning and fail-closed controls
- ✅ Cleanup UX guard rails: Mandatory dry-run previews, typed confirmation for out-of-root targets, and JSON audit manifests shipped

**Observability & Intelligence Improvements:**

- ✅ Enhanced logging: Added info-level logging for release download/install operations
- ✅ Error handling: Improved guard-rails error reporting with clear failure messages
- ✅ Frontier audit doc: Authored comprehensive red team & gap analysis and published via MkDocs nav

| -------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| High     | Release supply chain    | Wheelhouse installs now fail closed without matching SHA-256 manifests and validate Sigstore bundles when they are published.                                                                                                     | Supply-chain compromise risk narrows to unsigned archives and unpinned identities. | Backfill Sigstore bundles for historical releases, require identities via `--sigstore-identity`, and enable `--require-sigstore` in automation to block unsigned installs.                                                                          | Tooling | In Progress |
| High     | Cleanup ergonomics      | `cleanup` will happily scrub any `--extra-path` (even `/`), and when invoked outside a git repo it treats the CWD as root. A typo can wipe unrelated directories.                                                                 | Catastrophic operator error / accidental data loss.                                | Refuse to operate on paths outside the repo unless `--allow-outside-root` (with confirmation), disallow `/` and home directory targets, and emit a dry-run summary before deletion.                                                                 | DX      | Complete    |
| Medium   | Guard rail availability | The `guard_rails` command is defined inside the `cleanup` function, so it is only registered after the cleanup command runs once per process. Fresh shells cannot invoke guard rails and therefore skip automated security scans. | Guard rails silently unavailable -> reduced local/AppSec coverage.                 | Hoist `_format_command` and `guard_rails` to module scope, add a regression test that `cli.app.registered_commands` includes `guard-rails` pre-execution, and document expected usage. Current local edits regressed command wiring—needs re-hoist. | DX      | Complete    |
| Low      | Asset name sanitisation | Release assets are written to disk using the server-provided filename without validating path separators. GitHub currently rejects `/`, but defensive sanitisation is advisable.                                                  | Future path traversal if upstream validation changes.                              | Strip `..`/path separators from asset names before joining paths and log when sanitisation occurs.                                                                                                                                                  | Tooling | Complete    |

## Engineering Gaps & Opportunities

| Priority | Theme                        | Gap                                                                                                                       | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High     | Secure development lifecycle | No `SECURITY.md` or published disclosure process; threat models live implicitly in docs.                                  | Add a `SECURITY.md`, document contact channels, expected SLAs, and link it from README & docs. Run a lightweight STRIDE-style threat model for the CLI + release pipeline and archive it under `docs/adr/`. |
| High     | Test reliability             | Pytest suites rely on running `cleanup` before `guard-rails`; this masks the registration bug and could regress silently. | Make tests order-independent (use pytest-randomly), restructure fixtures, and add explicit coverage for command registration.                                                                               |
| Medium   | Dependency hygiene           | Tooling pins (ruff 0.6.8, black 24.8.0, pip-audit ignore) are several releases behind as of Oct 2025.                     | Refresh `pyproject.toml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, drop stale ignores once upstream patches land, and automate monthly dependency health checks beyond Dependabot (e.g., uv lockfile freshness).       |
| Medium   | Operational observability    | No telemetry around CLI/network failures; troubleshooting remote release installs is guesswork.                           | Emit structured logs/metrics (JSON events) for fetch/install stages and capture anonymised stats in CI (e.g., using OpenTelemetry exporters guarded behind env flags).                                      |
| Medium   | Documentation                | Cleanup safeguards, guard rail expectations, and release hardening steps are undocumented.                                | Add "Operating Safely" guide under `docs/how-to/` explaining cleanup constraints, guard-rail workflows, and release verification steps for contributors.                                                    |
| Low      | Incident readiness           | No documented rollback or release revocation procedure if a bad wheelhouse ships.                                         | Extend `docs/pre-release-checklist.md` with rollback guidance and automate revocation (delete releases, publish advisory).                                                                                  |

- **Threat Model**: STRIDE analysis documented in ADR
- **Operating Safely**: Comprehensive operational runbooks

## Risks / Notes

- pip-audit currently blocked by SSL trust chain inside container; rerun in CI or with configured cert bundle
- Attestation coverage: Backfill and enforce Sigstore bundles across historical releases to fully close the supply-chain risk
- Telemetry backlog blocks observability-driven SLOs; prioritise instrumentation once logging design is ready
- Monitor operator feedback on new cleanup preview/confirmation flow; extend with undo checkpoints if needed

## Feature Proposals

### 1. Intelligent planning & advisory layer

- Adaptive rollout planner: Upgrade `planning.build_plan` to ingest real churn/coverage metrics and produce prioritised playbooks per repo slice, exporting to JSON for dashboards.
- Risk radar service: Schedule periodic scans (via `toolbox`) that compute risk scores (coverage deltas, dependency drift) and publish to Ops targets (Slack, Grafana); surface alerts through the `plan` command.
- Scenario simulation: Provide “what-if” CLI flags (`plan --simulate-new-thresholds`) to model policy changes before touching CI.

### 2. Autonomic guard rails

- Self-healing cleanup agents: Extend `cleanup.run_cleanup` to run in watch mode, auto-reverting risky files and emitting structured reports to CI/CD logs.
- Policy-as-code bundles: Layer YAML policies on top of guard-rail runs (e.g., forbid certain dependency versions, enforce test naming) with evaluators that gate `guard-rails`.

_Note: Drift reconciliation completed. Use `hephaestus guard-rails --drift` to compare current toolchain versions with golden versions and get remediation commands._

### 3. AI-native workflows

- Agent SDK: Package Typer command schemas plus expected outputs so external agents (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) can invoke Hephaestus safely with predictable prompts and retry hints.

_Note: Agent SDK and command schema export completed. Use `hephaestus schema` command and see `docs/how-to/ai-agent-integration.md` guide._

- Code-mod rehearsal: Couple existing scripts with AI prompts to auto-generate candidate codemods, run dry-runs, and publish synthetic “before/after” diff bundles.

### 4. Release intelligence & supply-chain hardening

- Automated upgrade concierge: Use the existing TurboRepo monitor pattern for Python dependencies—detect vulnerable/outdated packages, open issues with reproduction scripts, and suggest minimal bump PR templates.

_Note: Sigstore attestation verification completed (see ADR-0006 for backfill strategy)._

### 5. Extensibility & ecosystem hooks

- Multi-repo orchestration: Offer `hephaestus plan --workspace <dir>` to cascade analytics and guard rails across fleets, syncing results to a central datastore.

_Note: Plugin architecture planned for Q2-Q3 2025 (see ADR-0002). OpenTelemetry spans planned for Q2 2025 (see ADR-0003)._

### 6. Documentation & knowledge loop

- Living Diátaxis sync: Auto-derive doc stubs from new CLI options/tests and update docs via a `hephaestus docs sync` command to keep instructions in lockstep.
- Cross-tool tutorials: Generate “playbooks” combining cleanup, planning, release, and refactor scripts for common scenarios (e.g., “ship a refactor in a week”) with CLI commands and expected outputs.

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

With all core infrastructure complete, the project is now in maintenance mode with planned future enhancements:

1. **Sprint 2 (Next - Manual Execution Required)**:
   - Backfill Sigstore bundles for historical releases (ADR-0006 - script ready, requires manual trigger)
   - PyPI account registration and Trusted Publisher setup (ADR-0005 - workflow ready)
2. **Sprint 3**: Complete PyPI publication launch (ADR-0005)
3. **Sprint 4**: Implement OpenTelemetry advanced features (ADR-0003) and plugin marketplace (ADR-0002)
4. **Future**: Deliver REST/gRPC API implementation (ADR-0004)

### Decision Framework

When prioritizing future features from the proposals above, consider:

- **Impact**: How many users/workflows benefit?
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity and maintenance burden
- **Dependencies**: What foundational work is required?
- **Community**: Is there external demand or contribution interest?

Current recommendation: Focus on completing Sprint 2 manual prerequisites (Sigstore backfill execution, PyPI account setup) before starting Sprint 3 work.
