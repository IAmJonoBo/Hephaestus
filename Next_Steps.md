| -------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| High     | Release supply chain    | Wheelhouse installs now fail closed without matching SHA-256 manifests and validate Sigstore bundles when they are published.                                                                                                     | Supply-chain compromise risk narrows to unsigned archives and unpinned identities. | Backfill Sigstore bundles for historical releases, require identities via `--sigstore-identity`, and enable `--require-sigstore` in automation to block unsigned installs.                                                                          | Tooling | In Progress |
| High     | Cleanup ergonomics      | `cleanup` will happily scrub any `--extra-path` (even `/`), and when invoked outside a git repo it treats the CWD as root. A typo can wipe unrelated directories.                                                                 | Catastrophic operator error / accidental data loss.                                | Refuse to operate on paths outside the repo unless `--allow-outside-root` (with confirmation), disallow `/` and home directory targets, and emit a dry-run summary before deletion.                                                                 | DX      | Complete    |
| Medium   | Guard rail availability | The `guard_rails` command is defined inside the `cleanup` function, so it is only registered after the cleanup command runs once per process. Fresh shells cannot invoke guard rails and therefore skip automated security scans. | Guard rails silently unavailable -> reduced local/AppSec coverage.                 | Hoist `_format_command` and `guard_rails` to module scope, add a regression test that `cli.app.registered_commands` includes `guard-rails` pre-execution, and document expected usage. Current local edits regressed command wiring—needs re-hoist. | DX      | Complete    |
| Low      | Asset name sanitisation | Release assets are written to disk using the server-provided filename without validating path separators. GitHub currently rejects `/`, but defensive sanitisation is advisable.                                                  | Future path traversal if upstream validation changes.                              | Strip `..`/path separators from asset names before joining paths and log when sanitisation occurs.                                                                                                                                                  | Tooling | Complete    |

## Engineering Gaps & Opportunities

| Priority | Theme                        | Gap                                                                                                                       | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High     | Secure development lifecycle | No `SECURITY.md` or published disclosure process; threat models live implicitly in docs.                                  | Add a `SECURITY.md`, document contact channels, expected SLAs, and link it from README & docs. Run a lightweight STRIDE-style threat model for the CLI + release pipeline and archive it under `docs/adr/`. |
| High     | Test reliability             | Pytest suites rely on running `cleanup` before `guard-rails`; this masks the registration bug and could regress silently. | Make tests order-independent (use pytest-randomly), restructure fixtures, and add explicit coverage for command registration.                                                                               |
| Medium   | Dependency hygiene           | Tooling pins (ruff 0.6.8, black 24.8.0, pip-audit ignore) are several releases behind as of Oct 2025.                     | Refresh `pyproject.toml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, drop stale ignores once upstream patches land, and automate monthly dependency health checks beyond Dependabot (e.g., uv lockfile freshness).       |
| Medium   | Operational observability    | No telemetry around CLI/network failures; troubleshooting remote release installs is guesswork.                           | Emit structured logs/metrics (JSON events) for fetch/install stages and capture anonymised stats in CI (e.g., using OpenTelemetry exporters guarded behind env flags).                                      |
| Medium   | Documentation                | Cleanup safeguards, guard rail expectations, and release hardening steps are undocumented.                                | Add "Operating Safely" guide under `docs/how-to/` explaining cleanup constraints, guard-rail workflows, and release verification steps for contributors.                                                    |
| Low      | Incident readiness           | No documented rollback or release revocation procedure if a bad wheelhouse ships.                                         | Extend `docs/pre-release-checklist.md` with rollback guidance and automate revocation (delete releases, publish advisory).                                                                                  |

## Frontier Quality Standards

This project enforces frontier-level quality standards through automated gates:

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: Ruff with strict configuration (E, F, I, UP, B, C4 rules)
- **Formatting**: Ruff format with 100-character line length
- **Type Safety**: Mypy strict mode with full coverage of src and tests
- **Architecture**: Nested decorator linting prevents command registration bugs

### Testing

- **Coverage**: Minimum 85% test coverage enforced by pytest-cov
- **Randomization**: pytest-randomly ensures test independence
- **Warnings**: All warnings treated as errors to prevent degradation

### Security

- **Dependency Auditing**: pip-audit with strict mode in CI
- **Dangerous Path Protection**: Cleanup command guards against data loss
- **Release Verification**: SHA-256 checksums + Sigstore attestation support

### Automation

- **CI Pipeline**: All checks run on every PR and push to main
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local validation before commits
- **Guard Rails**: One-command validation via `hephaestus guard-rails`

### Documentation

- **Diátaxis Structure**: How-to guides, explanations, tutorials, reference
- **Security Policy**: Published disclosure process and SLAs
- **Threat Model**: STRIDE analysis documented in ADR
- **Operating Safely**: Comprehensive operational runbooks

## Risks / Notes

- pip-audit currently blocked by SSL trust chain inside container; rerun in CI or with configured cert bundle
- Attestation coverage: Backfill and enforce Sigstore bundles across historical releases to fully close the supply-chain risk
- Telemetry backlog blocks observability-driven SLOs; prioritise instrumentation once logging design is ready
- Monitor operator feedback on new cleanup preview/confirmation flow; extend with undo checkpoints if needed

## Feature Proposals

### 1. Intelligent planning & advisory layer

- Adaptive rollout planner: Upgrade `planning.build_plan` to ingest real churn/coverage metrics and produce prioritised playbooks per repo slice, exporting to JSON for dashboards.
- Risk radar service: Schedule periodic scans (via `toolbox`) that compute risk scores (coverage deltas, dependency drift) and publish to Ops targets (Slack, Grafana); surface alerts through the `plan` command.
- Scenario simulation: Provide “what-if” CLI flags (`plan --simulate-new-thresholds`) to model policy changes before touching CI.

### 2. Autonomic guard rails

- Self-healing cleanup agents: Extend `cleanup.run_cleanup` to run in watch mode, auto-reverting risky files and emitting structured reports to CI/CD logs.
- Policy-as-code bundles: Layer YAML policies on top of guard-rail runs (e.g., forbid certain dependency versions, enforce test naming) with evaluators that gate `guard-rails`.

_Note: Drift reconciliation completed. Use `hephaestus guard-rails --drift` to compare current toolchain versions with golden versions and get remediation commands._

### 3. AI-native workflows

- Agent SDK: Package Typer command schemas plus expected outputs so external agents (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) can invoke Hephaestus safely with predictable prompts and retry hints.

_Note: Agent SDK and command schema export completed. Use `hephaestus schema` command and see `docs/how-to/ai-agent-integration.md` guide._

- Code-mod rehearsal: Couple existing scripts with AI prompts to auto-generate candidate codemods, run dry-runs, and publish synthetic “before/after” diff bundles.

### 4. Release intelligence & supply-chain hardening

- Automated upgrade concierge: Use the existing TurboRepo monitor pattern for Python dependencies—detect vulnerable/outdated packages, open issues with reproduction scripts, and suggest minimal bump PR templates.

_Note: Sigstore attestation verification completed (see ADR-0006 for backfill strategy)._

### 5. Extensibility & ecosystem hooks

- Multi-repo orchestration: Offer `hephaestus plan --workspace <dir>` to cascade analytics and guard rails across fleets, syncing results to a central datastore.

_Note: Plugin architecture planned for Q2-Q3 2025 (see ADR-0002). OpenTelemetry spans planned for Q2 2025 (see ADR-0003)._

### 6. Documentation & knowledge loop

- Living Diátaxis sync: Auto-derive doc stubs from new CLI options/tests and update docs via a `hephaestus docs sync` command to keep instructions in lockstep.
- Cross-tool tutorials: Generate “playbooks” combining cleanup, planning, release, and refactor scripts for common scenarios (e.g., “ship a refactor in a week”) with CLI commands and expected outputs.

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

With all core infrastructure complete, the project is now in maintenance mode with planned future enhancements:

1. **Q1 2025 (Current)**:
   - Backfill Sigstore bundles for historical releases (ADR-0006)
   - PyPI publication automation (ADR-0005)
2. **Q2 2025**: Implement OpenTelemetry spans (ADR-0003 Phase 2-3)
3. **Q2-Q3 2025**: Deliver plugin architecture (ADR-0002) and REST/gRPC API (ADR-0004)

### Decision Framework

When prioritizing future features from the proposals above, consider:

- **Impact**: How many users/workflows benefit?
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity and maintenance burden
- **Dependencies**: What foundational work is required?
- **Community**: Is there external demand or contribution interest?
