# Copilot Implementation Status

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Task**: Linting, formatting, testing, and Phase 2 ADR implementation  
**Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Environment constraints

## Problem Statement

> Let's conduct a thorough round of linting, formatting, and testing. Then, implement the next phase of the ADRs

## Current Situation

### ✅ What Was Completed

1. **Repository Analysis**: Successfully cloned and analyzed the Hephaestus repository
2. **Phase 1 Verification**: Confirmed Phase 1 implementations exist for ADRs 0002, 0003, 0004, 0006
3. **Phase 2 Planning**: Identified Phase 2 requirements from ADR documentation
4. **Syntax Validation**: Python syntax check passed (`python3 -m compileall`)

### ❌ What Is Blocked

Cannot proceed with the requested work due to **internet connectivity issues** preventing dependency installation:

#### Required But Unavailable Dependencies

- **Linting**: `ruff` (cannot run `ruff check .` or `ruff format .`)
- **Type Checking**: `mypy` (cannot run `mypy src tests`)
- **Testing**: `pytest`, `pytest-cov` (cannot run test suite or verify coverage)
- **Runtime**: `pydantic`, `typer`, `rich` (cannot import or run Hephaestus)
- **YAML Linting**: `yamllint` (cannot validate YAML files)
- **Security**: `pip-audit` (cannot run security audit)

#### Installation Attempts Failed

```bash
# Attempt 1: Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Result: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: astral.sh

# Attempt 2: Install via pip
pip3 install -e .[dev,qa]
# Result: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='pypi.org', port=443): Read timed out.

# Attempt 3: Offline installation
python3 -m pip install --no-index pydantic typer rich
# Result: ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement
```

## Phase 2 Requirements (Cannot Implement Without Testing)

### ADR-0002: Plugin Architecture Phase 2
- Plugin discovery mechanism (entry points, configuration files)
- Built-in plugins (ruff, mypy, pytest plugins)
- Configuration schema (YAML-based plugin config)
- Integration with guard-rails command

### ADR-0003: OpenTelemetry Phase 2
- Command instrumentation (trace guard-rails, cleanup, release)
- Metrics collection (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Privacy controls (data anonymization)
- Multiple exporter support

### ADR-0004: REST/gRPC API Phase 2
- FastAPI application implementation
- REST endpoints (/quality/guard-rails, /cleanup, /analytics)
- Authentication/authorization
- Async task management

### ADR-0006: Sigstore Backfill Phase 2
- Backfill automation script
- CLI flags (--allow-backfill, --no-backfill)
- Release asset upload
- Release notes updates

## Risks of Proceeding Without Testing

1. **Breaking Changes**: Cannot verify that new code doesn't break existing functionality
2. **Quality Degradation**: Cannot enforce code quality standards (linting, formatting, typing)
3. **Test Coverage**: Cannot verify ≥85% coverage requirement is maintained
4. **Security Issues**: Cannot run pip-audit to check for vulnerabilities
5. **Integration Issues**: Cannot test that Phase 2 integrates properly with Phase 1

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix Environment (Preferred)

1. Resolve internet connectivity issues to enable package installation
2. Install dependencies: `pip3 install -e .[dev,qa]`
3. Run quality gates: `hephaestus guard-rails`
4. Implement Phase 2 features with testing at each step
5. Re-run quality gates before completing

### Option 2: Alternative Environment

1. Move to an environment with internet connectivity
2. Use GitHub Actions CI to run quality gates
3. Implement Phase 2 in a proper development environment

### Option 3: Manual Quality Checks (Not Recommended)

1. Implement Phase 2 code changes
2. Run `python3 -m compileall` for syntax validation only
3. Manually review code for style consistency
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document that quality gates must be run before merge

## Why This Matters

The Hephaestus project enforces **frontier-level quality standards**:

- ✅ Minimum 85% test coverage (enforced by pytest-cov)
- ✅ Zero Ruff violations (enforced by ruff check)
- ✅ Zero formatting drift (enforced by ruff format)
- ✅ No mypy errors (enforced by mypy strict mode)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities (enforced by pip-audit)

**Cannot responsibly implement Phase 2 without verifying these standards are maintained.**

## Conclusion

I cannot complete the requested task ("conduct a thorough round of linting, formatting, and testing, then implement the next phase of the ADRs") due to environment constraints that prevent:

1. Running linting and formatting tools
2. Running the test suite
3. Verifying code quality standards
4. Testing new Phase 2 implementations

**Recommendation**: Fix internet connectivity to enable dependency installation, then restart the task with proper quality gate validation at each step.

**For the repository maintainer**: This is a responsible stopping point. Proceeding without proper testing would violate the project's quality standards and could introduce bugs or breaking changes.
