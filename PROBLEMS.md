Consider the error, the related scripts, and pipeline, and how to ensure that settings are automatically changed so that the environment is set up correctly. The entire setup should be intelligent, automated, resilient, self- and autoremediating from a single command so that everything is automatically set up and corrected/remedied where required, including ensuring dependencies are synced or downloaded, then verified until everything runs green. This should be made foolproof. We need to make this as DX and UX-friendly as possible. It NEEDS to work without failures or blocks:
