## ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed ‚Üí Accepted ‚Üí Implemented ‚Üí Superseded/Deprecated
```

### Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Decision documented, awaiting review and acceptance
- **Accepted**: Decision approved, implementation scheduled
- **Implemented**: Decision fully implemented in codebase
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by a newer ADR
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer applicable

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `0000-template.md` to `NNNN-title.md` (use next sequential number)
2. Fill in the template sections:
   - Context: Why this decision is needed
   - Decision: What we're deciding to do
   - Consequences: Positive, negative, and risks
   - Alternatives: What else we considered
   - Implementation Plan: Phased rollout timeline
3. Submit as PR for review
4. Update this index when accepted

## ADR Format

All ADRs follow a consistent structure:

- **Metadata**: Status, date, relationships
- **Context**: Problem statement and motivating forces
- **Decision**: The architectural decision being made
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, risks, and mitigations
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches evaluated
- **Implementation Plan**: Phased rollout with milestones
- **Follow-up Actions**: Specific tasks with owners and dates
- **References**: Related documentation and resources

- [Next Steps Tracker](../../Next_Steps.md) - Implementation status and roadmap

## Decision Framework

When prioritizing ADR implementation, consider:

- **Impact**: How many users/workflows benefit?
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity and maintenance burden
- **Dependencies**: What foundational work is required?
- **Community**: Is there external demand or contribution interest?
- **Security**: Does this address threat model findings?
- **Stability**: Is the technical landscape mature enough?

- After major feature additions
- When technical assumptions change
- When community feedback suggests changes
