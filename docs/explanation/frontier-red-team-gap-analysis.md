# Frontier Readiness Red Team & Gap Analysis

## Scope & Approach

This round of the red team validated Hephaestus across guard-rails, streaming analytics, remediation automation, release supply chain, and remote API interfaces. Reviews combined STRIDE modelling, fuzz testing of FastAPI/gRPC flows, destructive cleanup simulations, and Sigstore bundle tampering drills. Telemetry traces and audit manifests were inspected to confirm the latest instrumentation upgrades.

## Attack Surface Snapshot

- **CLI & Automation** – Typer-based orchestration now exposes auto-remediation, drift gates, and analytics ingestion commands with structured logging and audit manifests. Failure paths abort when required tooling/plugins are absent.
- **FastAPI & gRPC Services** – Shared `api.service` engine powers guard-rails, cleanup, analytics rankings, remediation manifests, and streaming ingestion. Background task orchestration uses cancellable futures with bounded timeouts; clients receive deterministic payloads.
- **Streaming Analytics** – NDJSON REST ingestion and gRPC client-streaming feed a shared ingestor that snapshots submissions for rankings. Inputs are validated and capped; telemetry events trace acceptance/rejections.
- **Supply Chain & Releases** – Sigstore verification, SHA-256 manifest enforcement, and drift detection are wired into CLI, CI, and API responses. Backfill metadata exists for historical releases pending execution.
- **Telemetry & Observability** – OpenTelemetry spans wrap CLI/API/remediation commands with graceful no-op fallbacks. Structured JSON logging and audit manifests remain the primary operator artefacts until exporters land.

## Key Findings

| Severity   | Area              | Observation                                                                                                               | Recommended Remediation                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**   | API Security      | FastAPI and gRPC endpoints trust network perimeter controls; no first-party auth, RBAC, or rate limits.                   | Implement auth tokens/service accounts, audit logging, and per-tenant quotas. Document threat model updates in ADR-0004 Sprint 2+. |
| **High**   | Supply Chain      | Sigstore bundle schema and CLI integration exist, but historical releases lack attested bundles.                          | Execute ADR-0006 Sprint 2 backfill, enforce `--require-sigstore` in CI, and publish attestation inventory.                         |
| **Medium** | Telemetry         | Command spans exist yet sampling/export configuration is manual and no Prometheus metrics are emitted.                    | Deliver ADR-0003 Sprint 4: sampling strategies, OTLP exporter, Prometheus bridge, and SLO dashboards.                              |
| **Medium** | Analytics         | Streaming ingestion persists in-memory snapshots only; no retention policy or visibility into ingestion health.           | Add persistence backend, retention knobs, and telemetry metrics (acceptance rate, latency, error classes).                         |
| **Medium** | Automation Safety | Auto-remediation runs with deterministic manifests but lacks rate limits and audit trail aggregation across CI runs.      | Introduce remediation budget guards, central audit sink, and operator approval gates for high-impact fixes.                        |
| **Low**    | Plugin Ecosystem  | Discovery clears registries and honours disabled built-ins, but marketplace metadata (versioning, deps, trust) is absent. | Expand ADR-0002 Sprint 4 to cover marketplace schema, dependency resolution, and signed plugin manifests.                          |

## Gap Themes

### Security & Compliance

- Need authenticated APIs, signed Sigstore backfill, and continuous attestation verification.
- Secret management guidance for API deployments is pending; integrate with Ops runbooks.

### Observability & DX

- Export spans/metrics for guard-rails, remediation, and ingestion to provide latency/error budgets.
- Provide dashboards and CLI summaries of streaming ingestion health.

### Automation & Safety

- Rate-limit remediation triggers and add human-in-the-loop override for destructive commands.
- Persist analytics snapshots and remediation results for replayable audits.

### AI & Ecosystem

- Extend schema exports with plugin capability metadata and remediation manifest references for agents.
- Build marketplace trust signals (signatures, compatibility) before enabling third-party plugin installs.

## Recommended Roadmap Updates

1. **Execute Sigstore backfill (ADR-0006 Sprint 2)** – Run staging dry-run, publish attestation index, enforce in CI.
2. **Ship API auth (ADR-0004 Sprint 2+)** – Add service account tokens, RBAC roles, request signing, and telemetry for auth failures.
3. **Complete OpenTelemetry Sprint 4 (ADR-0003)** – Sampling controls, Prometheus exporter, dashboards, and doc updates.
4. **Analytics durability** – Choose persistence layer, retention policy, and metrics instrumentation; expose CLI/API endpoints for ingestion health.
5. **Remediation governance** – Introduce budgets, approval gates, and aggregated audit trails for automated fixes.
6. **Plugin marketplace design (ADR-0002 Sprint 4)** – Define metadata schema, dependency resolution, trust policies, and publish discovery guide.
7. **Continuous red teaming** – Automate adversarial test suite that replays Sigstore tampering, API abuse, and remediation runaway scenarios.

## Quality Gates & Tracking

## Scope & Method

This assessment stress-tests Hephaestus across its primary safety-, quality-, and automation-critical workflows. We combined STRIDE threat modelling, code-level review, negative test design, and operator journey mapping to evaluate:

- **CLI orchestration and guard rails** that coordinate cleanup, QA, and rollout tasks (`src/hephaestus/cli.py`).
- **Release supply-chain automation** responsible for downloading, extracting, and installing wheelhouse bundles (`src/hephaestus/release.py`).
- **Workspace hygiene tooling** that performs destructive filesystem operations (`src/hephaestus/cleanup.py`).
- **Refactoring analytics scaffolding** that prioritises hotspots, coverage gaps, and advisory workstreams (`src/hephaestus/toolbox.py`).
- **Documentation, playbooks, and MkDocs site** to confirm operator guidance keeps pace with the implementation (`README.md`, `docs/` tree).

Each area was reviewed for adversarial misuse potential, resilience under failure, telemetry coverage, and UX/operability at scale. Findings are mapped to severity, residual risk, and remediation priorities.

## Attack Surface Overview

### CLI Orchestration

The Typer-based CLI exposes nested command groups for tooling, QA, release operations, cleanup, and guard rails (`app`, `tools_app`, and child apps). It shells out to the Python interpreter for pip installs and surfaces plan, coverage, and refactor analytics (`src/hephaestus/cli.py`). The CLI inherits the safeguards of the underlying modules but currently lacks structured logging and dry-run previews for destructive flows.

### Release Supply Chain

Release automation fetches GitHub release metadata, sanitises asset names, applies retry/backoff with bounded timeouts, and installs wheels through pip (`src/hephaestus/release.py`). Network operations are authenticated via HTTPS/GitHub tokens, SHA-256 manifests are required by default, and Sigstore bundles are downloaded and verified when published. Residual risk centres on enforcing identity policies and ensuring every historical release ships an attestation.

### Workspace Cleanup

The cleanup engine guards dangerous roots, normalises extra paths, and removes caches, build artefacts, and macOS metadata (`src/hephaestus/cleanup.py`). Protections include hard blocklists for `/`, `/home`, `/usr`, `/etc`, and other critical directories. However, operations outside the repository still lack confirmation prompts or dry-run manifests, so user error remains a latent risk.

### Refactoring Analytics Toolkit

Refactor planning utilities load YAML configuration, generate deterministic hotspot rankings, and emit advisory opportunities (`src/hephaestus/toolbox.py`). New analytics adapters can ingest churn, coverage, and embedding exports directly from YAML/JSON sources, replacing the synthetic fallbacks for repositories that wire in live feeds. Remaining limitations centre on correlation across repositories and incremental refresh automation, which still requires manual orchestration.

## Key Findings & Residual Risks

| Severity   | Area                    | Observation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Recommended Remediation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Medium** | Release supply chain    | Wheelhouse installs now fail closed without matching SHA-256 manifests and verify Sigstore bundles when available (`src/hephaestus/release.py`). Remaining exposure stems from repositories that have not yet published bundles or whose attestations do not match trusted identities. | Enforce Sigstore identity policies via `--sigstore-identity`, require attestations with `--require-sigstore` in automated environments, and backfill bundles for historical releases. Integrate attestation metadata into audit logs for downstream verification. |
| **High**   | Workspace hygiene       | Cleanup now enforces a mandatory dry-run preview, typed confirmation for targets outside the repository root, and writes JSON audit manifests for every run (`src/hephaestus/cleanup.py`, `src/hephaestus/cli.py`).                                                                    | Continue layering additional controls such as signed manifests and reversible deletions for environments that demand forensic-grade traceability.                                                                                                                 |
| **Medium** | Observability           | CLI and release helpers emit ad-hoc `logger.info` messages without structured context or correlation IDs (`src/hephaestus/release.py`, `src/hephaestus/cli.py`). Incident triage and fleet-wide metrics are limited.                                                                   | Adopt structured JSON logging with run IDs, command metadata, and timing. Provide file-based audit logs for destructive flows and expose OpenTelemetry exporters guarded by environment flags.                                                                    |
| **Medium** | AI/automation readiness | Refactor analytics now support pluggable churn, coverage, and embedding adapters via `src/hephaestus/analytics.py`, unlocking data-backed hotspot rankings when repositories export telemetry. Automated refresh and richer risk scoring remain open.                                  | Extend adapters with incremental sync tooling, add historical trend analysis, and expose a vector-friendly API so AI copilots can query hotspots, dependencies, and rollout playbooks in real time.                                                               |
| **Low**    | UX & guard rails        | CLI commands lack progressive disclosure for long-running tasks (no progress bars, ETA hints) and omit contextual help for advanced flags (`src/hephaestus/cli.py`). Operators may misconfigure options under stress.                                                                  | Integrate Rich progress renderers, contextual examples in help text, and guard-rail suggestions when thresholds are breached.                                                                                                                                     |

## Gap Analysis

### Quality & Coverage

- Test coverage enforces an 85% floor via pytest-cov defaults in `pyproject.toml`, yet release retry/backoff logic and cleanup safety rails were under-tested. New regression tests now exercise timeout validation, retry escalation, and sanitisation edge cases to prevent silent regressions (`tests/test_release.py`).
- Release CLI workflows now cover archive cleanup, Sigstore backfill command wiring, and Ruff plugin failure handling, pushing total coverage to 86.95% and guarding against packaging regressions (`tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_plugins_integration.py`).
- CLI release install wiring now has regression coverage for Sigstore pattern/identity flags (`tests/test_cli.py`), including multi-pattern identity matching to guard against accidental bypasses of the supply-chain gates.
- Characterisation tests remain sparse for cleanup and planning flows; add scenario suites to lock down failure semantics before shipping automation.

### Security & Compliance

- STRIDE ADR outlines supply-chain and cleanup threats. Checksum enforcement and Sigstore verification now gate wheelhouse installs, but we still need identity policies, attested cleanup manifests, and security sign-off gates that verify these controls before release.
- Secret redaction is manual; expand token redaction utilities to cover CLI output, logs, and exceptions.

### Observability & Telemetry

- Structured JSON logging with run IDs is in place and now backed by a central telemetry event schema plus CLI operation correlation identifiers. Remaining gaps include tracing/span export and metrics—introducing OpenTelemetry instrumentation around release downloads, cleanup sweeps, and guard-rail pipelines would unblock SLO tracking and anomaly detection. Cleanup continues to emit structured audit manifests for post-run inspection; next steps include wiring those artefacts into telemetry sinks.

### Developer Experience

- No dry-run or preview for cleanup and release install flows reduces operator confidence. Provide interactive confirmations, plan visualisations, and recoverable trash bins for deleted artefacts.
- CLI help should surface recommended workflows (e.g., `guard-rails` before commits) and link to operating guides directly from `--help` output.

### AI & Frontier Capabilities

- Toolkit analytics can now ingest churn, coverage, and embedding exports, providing data-backed hotspots and refactor suggestions when telemetry files are present. Next steps include streaming ingestion, prompt-ready summaries, and API endpoints so AI agents can query tasks programmatically.
- Introduce policy-based guard rails allowing AI operators to request automation only within whitelisted directories or branches, enforced via CLI and cleanup options.

### Remote API, Deployment, and Sync

- The REST API skeleton now offers authenticated guard-rails, cleanup, and rankings endpoints, but background task orchestration still relied on unbounded polling loops that could hang clients and leak sockets. Recent hardening layers cancellable tasks, bounded wait timeouts, and streaming safeguards, yet production deployments still require distributed task backends, persistence of task metadata, and health probes that cover both the FastAPI process and worker pool.
- Remote/local environment sync remains largely manual. Operators must trigger `guard-rails` locally before invoking the remote API; there is no bidirectional sync of manifests, cleanup audit logs, or telemetry. A deployment-grade solution should replicate manifests and task audit trails to shared storage, enforce version pinning between local CLI and remote API, and supply migration tooling when schema changes occur.
- Dev/stage/prod parity is partially addressed via `uv` lockfiles and setup scripts, but the API server lacks declarative configuration for feature flags, telemetry endpoints, and network policies. Harden deployment descriptors (Helm charts, Docker Compose) with environment validation, secret management, and automated smoke checks that mirror the local guard-rail pipeline.

## Frontier-Grade Roadmap Recommendations

1. **Supply-Chain Hardening:** Enforce Sigstore identity policies, publish attestations for every release, and surface attestation metadata in audit logs so operators can trace provenance end-to-end. Provide continuous scanning of release archives post-download.
2. **Structured Operational Telemetry:** Implement JSON logging and OpenTelemetry tracing for CLI invocations, release downloads, cleanup operations, and QA pipelines. Expose dashboards for retries, failure modes, and duration percentiles.
3. **Refactor Intelligence Platform:** Replace synthetic analytics with adapters that ingest git churn, coverage heatmaps, static analysis (Ruff/Mypy), and ML embeddings. Offer ranking APIs and CLI visualisations for hotspots, risk scores, and effort models.
4. **AI Co-Pilot Interfaces:** Publish a gRPC/REST layer enabling autonomous agents to request refactor plans, QA profiles, and guard-rail enforcement. Include sandboxed “what-if” simulators to rehearse rollout plans and evaluate blast radius before execution.
5. **Progressive Safety Controls:** Add dry-run manifests, undo checkpoints, and interactive confirmations for cleanup and release installation. Provide emergency stop commands wired into guard-rail pipelines.
6. **Resilient Remote Tasking:** Replace in-memory task tracking with a distributed queue (e.g., Redis, Postgres, or durable message bus), surface task heartbeats, and expose cancel/retry semantics through the API. Synchronise audit manifests between local runs and remote executions so operators can trace outcomes regardless of origin.
7. **Integrated Quality Console:** Bundle a Rich- or Textual-based TUI that aggregates guard-rail status, coverage deltas, dependency risks, and release readiness in one place for operators.
8. **Continuous Gap Audits:** Automate periodic red-team exercises that run scripted adversarial scenarios against cleanup, release, and analytics modules, logging drift from expected controls.

## Quality Gates & Next Steps

- Expand regression coverage across release retries, sanitisation, and configuration propagation (added in `tests/test_release.py`).
- Track remediation of high-severity findings (checksum verification, cleanup dry-runs) in `Next_Steps.md` to ensure accountability.
- Prioritise structured telemetry and AI-ready analytics in the upcoming iteration to unlock frontier-grade automation.
