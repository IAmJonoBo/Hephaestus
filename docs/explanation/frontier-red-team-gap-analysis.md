# Frontier Readiness Red Team & Gap Analysis

## Scope & Approach
This round of the red team validated Hephaestus across guard-rails, streaming analytics, remediation automation, release supply chain, and remote API interfaces. Reviews combined STRIDE modelling, fuzz testing of FastAPI/gRPC flows, destructive cleanup simulations, and Sigstore bundle tampering drills. Telemetry traces and audit manifests were inspected to confirm the latest instrumentation upgrades.

## Attack Surface Snapshot
- **CLI & Automation** – Typer-based orchestration now exposes auto-remediation, drift gates, and analytics ingestion commands with structured logging and audit manifests. Failure paths abort when required tooling/plugins are absent.
- **FastAPI & gRPC Services** – Shared `api.service` engine powers guard-rails, cleanup, analytics rankings, remediation manifests, and streaming ingestion. Background task orchestration uses cancellable futures with bounded timeouts; clients receive deterministic payloads.
- **Streaming Analytics** – NDJSON REST ingestion and gRPC client-streaming feed a shared ingestor that snapshots submissions for rankings. Inputs are validated and capped; telemetry events trace acceptance/rejections.
- **Supply Chain & Releases** – Sigstore verification, SHA-256 manifest enforcement, and drift detection are wired into CLI, CI, and API responses. Backfill metadata exists for historical releases pending execution.
- **Telemetry & Observability** – OpenTelemetry spans wrap CLI/API/remediation commands with graceful no-op fallbacks. Structured JSON logging and audit manifests remain the primary operator artefacts until exporters land.

## Key Findings
| Severity | Area | Observation | Recommended Remediation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **High** | API Security | FastAPI and gRPC endpoints trust network perimeter controls; no first-party auth, RBAC, or rate limits. | Implement auth tokens/service accounts, audit logging, and per-tenant quotas. Document threat model updates in ADR-0004 Sprint 2+. |
| **High** | Supply Chain | Sigstore bundle schema and CLI integration exist, but historical releases lack attested bundles. | Execute ADR-0006 Sprint 2 backfill, enforce `--require-sigstore` in CI, and publish attestation inventory. |
| **Medium** | Telemetry | Command spans exist yet sampling/export configuration is manual and no Prometheus metrics are emitted. | Deliver ADR-0003 Sprint 4: sampling strategies, OTLP exporter, Prometheus bridge, and SLO dashboards. |
| **Medium** | Analytics | Streaming ingestion persists in-memory snapshots only; no retention policy or visibility into ingestion health. | Add persistence backend, retention knobs, and telemetry metrics (acceptance rate, latency, error classes). |
| **Medium** | Automation Safety | Auto-remediation runs with deterministic manifests but lacks rate limits and audit trail aggregation across CI runs. | Introduce remediation budget guards, central audit sink, and operator approval gates for high-impact fixes. |
| **Low** | Plugin Ecosystem | Discovery clears registries and honours disabled built-ins, but marketplace metadata (versioning, deps, trust) is absent. | Expand ADR-0002 Sprint 4 to cover marketplace schema, dependency resolution, and signed plugin manifests. |

## Gap Themes
### Security & Compliance
- Need authenticated APIs, signed Sigstore backfill, and continuous attestation verification.
- Secret management guidance for API deployments is pending; integrate with Ops runbooks.

### Observability & DX
- Export spans/metrics for guard-rails, remediation, and ingestion to provide latency/error budgets.
- Provide dashboards and CLI summaries of streaming ingestion health.

### Automation & Safety
- Rate-limit remediation triggers and add human-in-the-loop override for destructive commands.
- Persist analytics snapshots and remediation results for replayable audits.

### AI & Ecosystem
- Extend schema exports with plugin capability metadata and remediation manifest references for agents.
- Build marketplace trust signals (signatures, compatibility) before enabling third-party plugin installs.

## Recommended Roadmap Updates
1. **Execute Sigstore backfill (ADR-0006 Sprint 2)** – Run staging dry-run, publish attestation index, enforce in CI.
2. **Ship API auth (ADR-0004 Sprint 2+)** – Add service account tokens, RBAC roles, request signing, and telemetry for auth failures.
3. **Complete OpenTelemetry Sprint 4 (ADR-0003)** – Sampling controls, Prometheus exporter, dashboards, and doc updates.
4. **Analytics durability** – Choose persistence layer, retention policy, and metrics instrumentation; expose CLI/API endpoints for ingestion health.
5. **Remediation governance** – Introduce budgets, approval gates, and aggregated audit trails for automated fixes.
6. **Plugin marketplace design (ADR-0002 Sprint 4)** – Define metadata schema, dependency resolution, trust policies, and publish discovery guide.
7. **Continuous red teaming** – Automate adversarial test suite that replays Sigstore tampering, API abuse, and remediation runaway scenarios.
