# Operating Safely with Hephaestus

This guide explains safety constraints, guard-rail workflows, and secure operational practices when using the Hephaestus toolkit.

## Cleanup Safety

The `hephaestus cleanup` command removes files and directories from your workspace. Understanding its safety features is critical to avoiding accidental data loss.

### Built-in Safety Features

1. **Git Repository Detection**: By default, cleanup operates from the git repository root. If no git repository is detected, it uses the current working directory.

2. **Excluded Paths**: The `.git` directory is excluded by default unless you explicitly pass `--include-git`.

3. **Virtual Environment Protection**: When cleaning build artifacts, the command preserves `.venv/site-packages` unless you're cleaning the virtual environment itself with `--include-poetry-env`.

### Dangerous Operations to Avoid

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never use these patterns:**

```bash
# DON'T: Clean the root filesystem
hephaestus cleanup /

# DON'T: Clean your home directory
hephaestus cleanup ~
hephaestus cleanup /home/username

# DON'T: Use wildcards or shell expansion with --extra-path
hephaestus cleanup --extra-path "*"
```

### Safe Usage Patterns

‚úÖ **Recommended patterns:**

```bash
# Clean current repository
hephaestus cleanup

# Clean specific subdirectory within the repo
hephaestus cleanup ./subproject

# Deep clean with all options
hephaestus cleanup --deep-clean

# Clean build artifacts only
hephaestus cleanup --build-artifacts

# Dry-run: Preview what would be removed (not yet implemented)
# hephaestus cleanup --dry-run --deep-clean
```

### Extra Paths

The `--extra-path` flag adds directories to the cleanup scope. **Always verify paths before using this flag:**

```bash
# Safe: Relative path within repository
hephaestus cleanup --extra-path ./legacy/dist

# Safe: Absolute path within repository
hephaestus cleanup --extra-path /home/user/projects/myrepo/temp

# UNSAFE: Path outside repository
hephaestus cleanup --extra-path /tmp
```

### Future Safety Enhancements

The following safety features are planned:

- **Dry-run mode**: Preview deletions before executing
- **Outside-repo protection**: Refuse to operate on paths outside the repository unless `--allow-outside-root` is passed
- **Interactive confirmation**: Prompt before deleting when using potentially dangerous flags
- **Blocklist**: Automatically reject dangerous paths (/, /home, /usr, /etc)

## Guard Rails Workflow

The `hephaestus guard-rails` command runs a comprehensive quality and security pipeline. It's designed to catch issues before they reach production.

### What Guard Rails Does

The guard-rails command executes these steps in order:

1. **Deep Cleanup**: Removes all build artifacts, caches, and macOS metadata
2. **Lint**: Checks code style and common errors with `ruff check`
3. **Format**: Auto-formats code with `ruff format` (skip with `--no-format`)
4. **Type Check**: Validates type annotations with `mypy`
5. **Test**: Runs the pytest suite with coverage reporting
6. **Security Audit**: Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities with `pip-audit`

### When to Use Guard Rails

**Before committing:**
```bash
hephaestus guard-rails
```

**Before opening a PR:**
```bash
hephaestus guard-rails
```

**After pulling changes:**
```bash
hephaestus guard-rails
```

**Skip formatting (useful for reviewing changes):**
```bash
hephaestus guard-rails --no-format
```

### Guard Rails in CI

The CI pipeline automatically runs guard rails on every push and pull request. Local execution ensures you catch issues before pushing.

### Troubleshooting Guard Rails

If guard rails fail:

1. **Lint failures**: Run `ruff check . --fix` to auto-fix issues
2. **Format failures**: Run `ruff format .` to format code
3. **Type failures**: Review mypy output and add/fix type annotations
4. **Test failures**: Run `pytest -v` for detailed test output
5. **Audit failures**: Review CVE details and update dependencies or add waivers

## Release Verification

When using `hephaestus release install`, follow these practices:

### Verify Release Source

```bash
# Always specify the repository explicitly
hephaestus release install --repository IAmJonoBo/Hephaestus

# Pin to a specific tag for reproducibility
hephaestus release install --tag v0.1.0
```

### Network Security

The release command includes several security features:

- **HTTPS only**: All downloads use HTTPS
- **Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts prevent hanging (default: 30s)
- **Retries**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (default: 3 attempts)
- **Token security**: Use environment variables for GitHub tokens

```bash
# Set token via environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
hephaestus release install

# Or pass it as an option
hephaestus release install --token ghp_your_token_here
```

### Future Verification Features

The following security enhancements are planned:

- **SHA-256 checksum verification**: Verify wheelhouse integrity before installation
- **Sigstore attestation**: Cryptographic proof of build provenance
- **Asset name sanitization**: Strip path separators from downloaded filenames
- **Manifest verification**: Validate against published manifests

## Secure Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to catch issues early:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

This automatically runs on every commit:
- Cleanup of macOS metadata
- Code formatting
- Linting
- Type checking
- Security audits

### Dependency Management

**Regular updates:**
```bash
# Check for outdated dependencies
pip list --outdated

# Run security audit
pip-audit --strict
```

**Review Dependabot PRs:**
- Always review dependency updates before merging
- Check changelogs for breaking changes
- Verify tests pass after updates

### Token Management

**Best practices:**
- Store tokens in environment variables or password managers
- Use fine-grained GitHub tokens with minimal permissions
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Never commit tokens to version control

### CI/CD Security

**Secrets management:**
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive values
- Never log tokens or credentials
- Audit workflow permissions regularly

## Incident Response

If you discover a security issue:

1. **Stop**: Don't push compromised code
2. **Report**: Follow the disclosure process in SECURITY.md
3. **Rotate**: Change any exposed credentials immediately
4. **Review**: Check git history for sensitive data
5. **Clean**: Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove secrets

## Rollback Procedures

If a bad release is deployed:

1. **Identify the issue**: Review release notes and changelogs
2. **Pin to last known good version**: 
   ```bash
   hephaestus release install --tag v0.0.9
   ```
3. **Report the issue**: Open a GitHub issue with details
4. **Document learnings**: Update documentation and tests

### Release Revocation (Future)

The following rollback features are planned:

- Automated release deletion from GitHub
- Security advisory publication
- Coordinated disclosure timeline
- Rollback automation in CI

## Monitoring and Telemetry

### Current Logging

Hephaestus logs to stdout/stderr using Rich formatting. Key events are highlighted:

- **Green**: Successful operations
- **Yellow**: Warnings and skipped operations
- **Red**: Errors and failures
- **Cyan**: Informational messages

### Future Telemetry

Planned observability features:

- **Structured JSON logs**: Machine-parseable event streams
- **OpenTelemetry spans**: Distributed tracing for CLI operations
- **Anonymous metrics**: Aggregated usage statistics (opt-in)
- **Failure tracking**: Network errors, timeout counts, retry attempts

All telemetry will be:
- **Opt-in**: Disabled by default, enabled via environment flag
- **Privacy-preserving**: No sensitive data or PII
- **Transparent**: Full disclosure of what's collected

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: See `docs/` for detailed guides
- **Issues**: Open a GitHub issue for bugs or feature requests
- **Security**: Email opensource@hephaestus.dev for security concerns
- **Community**: Check existing issues and discussions

## Summary Checklist

Before running potentially destructive operations:

- [ ] Verify you're in the correct directory
- [ ] Review paths and arguments carefully
- [ ] Check for typos in path specifications
- [ ] Consider running without `--deep-clean` first
- [ ] Ensure critical work is committed to git
- [ ] Have backups of important data

Remember: Hephaestus is a powerful tool. With power comes responsibility. Stay safe! üõ°Ô∏è
