3. Q2-Q3 2025: Consider plugin architecture and REST/gRPC API based on community demand

**Decision Framework:**
When prioritizing future features:

- **Impact**: How many users/workflows benefit?
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity and maintenance burden
- **Dependencies**: What foundational work is required?
- **Community**: Is there external demand or contribution interest?
